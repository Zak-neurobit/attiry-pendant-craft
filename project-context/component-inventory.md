## Data Flow Architecture

### Product Data Flow
```
Admin Upload → Supabase Products Table → useSupabaseProducts → Frontend Components
```

### Favorites Data Flow
```
User Action → useFavourites Store → Supabase Profiles Table → Favourites Page
```

### Authentication Data Flow
```
User Login → Supabase Auth → useAuth Store → Protected Components
```

## Integration Status

### Supabase Integration
- **Products**: ✅ Fully integrated with real data
- **Favorites**: ✅ Fully integrated with user profiles
- **Authentication**: ✅ Working with proper access control
- **User Behavior**: ✅ Recently viewed tracking
- **File Upload**: ✅ Product images via storage bucket

### State Management
- **Auth Store**: ✅ Working with Supabase auth
- **Favorites Store**: ✅ Working with Supabase profiles
- **Cart Store**: ✅ Working (local storage)
- **Product Customizer**: ✅ Working

## Performance Considerations

### Large Files Needing Refactoring
1. **ProductDetail.tsx** (421 lines)
   - Recommend: Split into ProductGallery, ProductInfo, ProductCustomizer
   
2. **Admin Products.tsx** (410 lines)
   - Recommend: Split into ProductList, ProductFilters, ProductActions
   
3. **Favourites.tsx** (219 lines)
   - Recommend: Extract ProductGrid, EmptyState components

4. **ImageUploader.tsx** (252 lines)
   - Recommend: Split into DropZone, ImageGrid, UploadProgress

### Optimization Opportunities
- **Image lazy loading**: Not implemented yet
- **Product pagination**: Not implemented yet
- **Search debouncing**: Could be improved
- **Cache strategies**: Could be implemented
