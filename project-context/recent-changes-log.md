## Technical Debt & Known Issues

### Large File Sizes (Needs Refactoring)
1. **ProductDetail.tsx** (421 lines)
   - Should split into smaller components
   - Consider: ProductGallery, ProductInfo, ProductCustomizer components

2. **Shop.tsx** (227 lines)
   - Product data could be extracted
   - Filter/sort functionality could be separate components

### Database Integration Needed
- Products currently use static data in `lib/products.ts`
- Need to migrate to Supabase tables
- Implement dynamic product loading

### Authentication Flow
- Current implementation works but may need session management improvements
- Consider implementing refresh token handling
- Add password reset functionality

## Performance Considerations

### Current Optimizations
- Lazy loading with React Router
- Image optimization needed
- Component-level code splitting

### Recommended Improvements
- Implement React.memo for ProductCard components
- Add image lazy loading
- Consider virtual scrolling for large product lists

## Security Updates

### Authentication Security
- Rate limiting implemented for login attempts
- Input validation on all forms
- Admin access properly restricted
- Audit logging for security events

### Data Validation
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Form validation with proper error handling
- Sanitized input processing

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Fix Product Detail Loading**: Ensure all product pages work correctly
2. **Database Migration**: Move from static to dynamic product data
3. **Component Refactoring**: Break down large components
4. **Performance Optimization**: Image loading and component optimization
5. **Testing**: Implement proper error boundaries and testing
